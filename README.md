Ruby is an object oriented programming language which means Ruby often involves manipulating objects.  

Objects are data with operations called functions attached to them. You can model real world objects (ie. phone, book, mastercard, etc) in Ruby using “Classes”.
Every object has attributes which are called “Instance Variables”, and capabilities which are called “Methods”

Each class can only inherit one other class’ attributes.

When attached to objects, those functions are also called “methods”.

An Attribute is a piece of data associated with an object. 

Dot notation is used to access attributes and methods from objects.
